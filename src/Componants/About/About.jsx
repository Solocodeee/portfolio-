          My name is Mostafa Ashmawy, and I am a front-end web developer. I am
          currently studying Computer Science and have a strong knowledge of
          programming. I am passionate about programming and all programming
          languages, but my true interest lies in web development. I have
          knowledge of UI/UX design and have been in the programming world for
          several years, with over a year of experience specifically in web
          development. I have worked on projects for several companies,
          including AIsite. I am looking forward to a bright future in the
          programming field and aim to contribute and help others.
